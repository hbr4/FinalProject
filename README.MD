## Hiren Rana Final Project
In this assignment, we looked at how to create HTML forms to create new records, update records, and a small form that has no fields other than a submit button to delete records.
The below screenshots are used to show project completion per all required elements. For this project, the Trees CSV file was used with the Flask application.
